# LSTM-for-Prediction
Using LSTM for univariate time series prediction

The main aim is to predict the output power generation of a Photovoltaic(PV) power system.

Historical time-series data of the PV output power is available. The data is cleaned and resampled before feeding to LSTM model for training.

The LSTM model should be able to predict the PV output power values at different time steps of the future.
